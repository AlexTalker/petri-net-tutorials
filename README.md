# Interactive Tutorials on Petri Nets

This repo is mainly a bodge consisting of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) and [original tutorial SWFs](https://www2.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/tgi/PetriNets/introductions/aalst/).

Since Adobe Flash became absolute legacy officially and it's quite difficult these days to make SWFs work on a single computer in the original way it was intended(i.e. by using browser plugin from Adobe or GNU GNASH or some other project),
I decided to quickly make the content of the examples available to everyone once again the easy way.

In general this is mostly a tribute to my master's degree course regarding modeling that references this wonderful set of examples back in 2018. Even back then it was quite difficult to make it run, so I thought about of one day making an improvement to the situation and here we are.

All the hard work and copyrights definitely belongs to original creators. My only intent is to make it more accessible and to backup SWFs in case of original(or at least the one that I know of) source goes down or gets removed.

In any case, if you experience some issues or want to make an update, feel free to fill in a PR!
