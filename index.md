## Interactive Tutorials on Petri Nets

This page is generally a tribute to [original tutoral](https://www2.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/tgi/PetriNets/introductions/aalst/) and mainly made to make old, Adobe Flash-based examples work again without much hustle.

All hard work and copyrights belong to original authors and this site mainly made to befriend original Adobe Flash-based solutions with modern browsers, and to keep a backup of them just in case due to education value.

Any issues and improvements shall be submitted via GitHub interface of this repository..
